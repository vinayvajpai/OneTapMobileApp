                                    <h5>Facebook Ads</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Facebook advertising is one of the most popular ways to drive acquisition and
                                        engagement for businesses around the world at all stages, from small business
                                        owners to larger companies with large budgets. Facebook's younger audience makes
                                        Facebook more useful for different business types like e-commerce (where people
                                        shop) or lifestyle businesses (e.g., beauty products). Google ads, on the other
                                        hand, is a great place to use if you have a product business. Facebook is good
                                        for a mixture of B2C and B2B brands.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Google Ads</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Google Ads is great for advertisers looking to drive traffic, increase brand
                                        awareness and increase conversions. Google Ads work by showing your ad to people
                                        who are browsing the web and using Google as well as to those that have been
                                        searching for keywords you've chosen. Google Ads can be used across many
                                        different devices, including phones, tablets and even computers.
                                        Google's broader audience makes it better for businesses looking to target
                                        audiences that are broader. Google Ads have several formats like ads, sponsored
                                        products, app extensions and more.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>A general rule of thumb</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Facebook and Instagram ads work best for low-cost products and to increase your
                                        brand awareness through creative storytelling.
                                        Google Ads on the other hand are more intent-based and therefore work best to
                                        attract website traffic, generate leads and get new customers.
                                    </p>

                                        There are 3 main objectives why you may want to consider running digital and
                                        social ads.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><strong>Increasing brand awareness</strong></h5>
                                    <p>Brand awareness is the most common objective.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        This might include ads for events, product launches, new services or even just to
                                        raise brand profile; in order to increase your business’s exposure and make it
                                        more visible on social media networks. Brand awareness is often used to develop
                                        a strong online presence and drive potential customers towards your business.
                                        This may be people who have previously not heard of you or new prospects looking
                                        for products or services in their area.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are a few things to consider when increasing brand awareness. Firstly, it’s
                                        important that your ads are creative and interesting – people will only stop and
                                        take notice if they stand out from the rest. Secondly, you need to ensure that
                                        your target audience is being reached effectively. Branding campaigns work best
                                        when there’s a specific group of people you’re targeting, so make sure that the
                                        demographics for your ads are correct. More on that later And finally, always
                                        measure and track results to see how successful your campaign has been.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><strong>Sending traffic to your website</strong></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Another common objective is increasing website traffic. This could be through ads
                                        that drive people to your website or even just getting them to click on a link.
                                        The main aim is to increase the number of visitors who come to your site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>There are a few things you can do to achieve this:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Make sure your website is optimised for your ads and is easy to navigate.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Use effective keywords in your ads that people are likely to search for.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Produce interesting, engaging ad content that people will want to read and
                                            or watch.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h5><strong>Getting conversions</strong></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The final main objective is conversions. This could be anything from getting
                                        people to sign up for a newsletter, filling in a contact form or buying a
                                        product.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When it comes to conversion-focused ads, there are a few key things to remember:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Firstly, you need to identify your target audience and create ads that
                                            appeal specifically to them.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            And secondly, make sure you’re using effective tracking methods to see how
                                            well your ads are performing and which demographics they reach best. This
                                            way you can ensure that budget is being spent in the right places and
                                            conversions will be maximised.
                                        </li>
                                        <p>
                                            So there we have it; these three objectives represent some of the most common
                                            reasons people run digital and social ads.

                                        When you create a digital ad campaign, it is important to make sure that you are
                                        targeting the audience who will most
                                        likely be interested in your product or service. This might seem like common
                                        sense; however, many companies make the
                                        mistake of creating their audience without considering what they want and need.
                                        We would like to offer you some tips on
                                        how to build an audience for your digital ad campaign that will help increase
                                        ROI and generate more revenue!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Start by identifying the audience you want to target. What kind of people are
                                        they? Where do they live? When do they
                                        like to shop for your product or service online and in person? Is there a
                                        specific age group, income level, or gender
                                        that is more likely than others to purchase what you're selling? If so, it's
                                        time to create your audience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Build a profile for each audience member. Start with the easiest audience, which
                                        is those who have purchased from you
                                        before or are already fans of your brand on social media. Then move towards
                                        building an audience that might need more
                                        convincing about what you offer to make the customers as well as those who may
                                        only be browsing at the moment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Create audience profiles that are clear and concise, but also include the
                                        information you need to target them with
                                        digital ads effectively. Then test your audience until you find one that works
                                        for your business!

                                        "You want to budget $5,000 for your next ad." This is a sentence that many
                                        business owners dread hearing. It sounds like
                                        a lot of money and it can be hard to know where to start with budgeting.
                                        Luckily, we have some tips on how you can
                                        choose the right budget for your next ad campaign!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When budgeting for a new ad campaign, you'll need to consider your targeting. Who
                                        are you trying to reach with your ad?
                                        Once you have a good idea of your target market, it will be easier to determine
                                        how much money you need to spend on
                                        advertising. You don't want to budget too little and not reach your desired
                                        audience, but budgeting too much could lead
                                        to wasted spending.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Next, you'll need to consider what kind of ad experience your target audience is
                                        looking for. If they're interested in a
                                        video ad, it may be worth budgeting more than if you were planning on running an
                                        image-based social media campaign.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, we recommend creating a budget that allows for some flexibility. Things
                                        always come up and you may need to
                                        adjust your budget as the campaign progresses. This way, you won't be too
                                        restricted in what you can do and you'll have
                                        room to make changes if needed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By following these tips, you can create a budget that will help your ad campaign
                                        succeed!

                                            Start small. Digital and social ads are incredibly flexible. Create lots of
                                            ads with small budgets. Test out many
                                            creatives, audiences, budgets, tag lines and copy. See what works and adjust
                                            the budget and targets along the way. You
                                            can go as low as $20 and as high as you can imagine so invest wisely.

                                        <li>
                                            The more popular the platform and the more specific your audience, the more
                                            budget you will need.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Allocate more budget to things that are working. Use the 95-5 rule where you
                                            can allocate 5% of your budget to try
                                            out new and experimental strategies with your targeting, audience creation
                                            and more. If it works, scale it up and if it
                                            doesn't you can always cut it out.

                                        When measuring brand awareness, you should look at how many people you reached.
                                        Metrics like Reach, Impressions and
                                        Views are helpful (Check out the <strong>definitions</strong> section for

                                            Focus on the important metrics. For example, look at Brand Awareness and you
                                            want to see how many times your ad has
                                            been served and potentially how many views your video has generated. For
                                            traffic, you want to see how many people
                                            clicked on the ad and out of those clicks how many people drove to the
                                            website? For conversions, you should measure
                                            actions like how many forms are filled or phone calls your ads generated.
